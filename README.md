# SMIDGE
Serpent and MCNP Input Design Graphical Environment

# About
SMIDGE is a user-friendly program to create input files for [Serpent](http://montecarlo.vtt.fi/) and [MCNP](https://mcnp.lanl.gov/).

# Where it is now
As I am just writing the README for the first time, there are no working features.

# Where it will go (hopefully)
SMIDGE will allow you to create input files for both MCNP and Serpent in a consistent graphical interface similar to that of COMSOL. It will provide a graphical interface for specifying input files, and an updated configurable 3d view of the model. It will allow for exporting and importing from both MCNP and Serpent input files. It will attempt to export in a human readable fashion. If exporting after importing, it will try to preserve the structure of the file as much as possible. It will extend the capabilities of lattices and provide scripting capabilities to remove tediousness from creating input files. A new, open, human-readable, file format will be created to allow for smaller file sizes and consistent editing experience.

# Contributing
Note: I am computer scientist and have no formal education or experience with nuclear engineering. Therefore, the help of professionals who use Serpent or MCNP and have no background in software is greatly appreciated.

If you have a background in nuclear engineering (or anything you use MCNP and Serpent for) you can:
  - Use this program
  - Report bugs
  - Recommend this to your colleges, students, professors, friends, family, cashiers, random people on the streets
  - Mention it in publications
  - Provide feedback on usability
  - Recommend features (even if it's on the list of planned features, recommendations will help prioritize)
  - Help write publications and user manuals
  - Help test and find bugs
  - Be patient with communicate to me. I am learning the nuclear side of this project as I go

If you have a background in computer science or are willing to learn more computer science, you can
  - Look at issues to find features or bugs to fix
  - Fork this project and make a WIP pull request to let me know what you are working on
  - Once you are done, or at least have working code, take away the WIP from the pull request

Expect me to be somewhat picky about the quality of code I merge in. Try to match the existing level of documentation and extensibility. Even if what you make is extremely niche, hacky or poor quality code to be merge in, I may give it a shout out, so don't hesitate to let me know what you have done!

If you have a strong background in both nuclear engineering and computer science, you maybe better qualified to run this project then me! Let me know what you think of it and where it should be going.

# Building
There is nothing to build now

# Technologies uses
Git, obviously
